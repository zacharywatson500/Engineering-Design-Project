Raspberry pi controls 360 degree servos with positional feedback. 

Takes input from an XBox 360 controller. The input from the controller determines how fast 3 different 
360 degree Servos turn. It also controls one regular servo as well. It also recives positional feedback from
an inbuilt encoder that the 360 servo has.
